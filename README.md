# Consolectiv EU (self-consumption tool for Europe)
A free online tool for the simulation of individual or collective self-consumption in Europe.
This free online tool is the fruit of collaboration between Lucisun and Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and is part of the COPLASIMON platform, developed in the framework of the Serendi-PV project.
The tool is composed of an interface for calculating the self-consumption ratio, the self-sufficiency ratio and other results for the self-consumption of the energy produced by photovoltaic installations in the whole Europe.
It is aimed at the general public, policymakers, and the photovoltaic installation professionals.
It has two main functionalities. One is for the individual prosumers. Another one is for energy communities.
So both for the prosumer and for a whole neighborhood, this Consolectiv contributes to help people make better informed decisions.
Test the tool at https://consolectiv.eu/index.html and open issues in this repository for any question you may have.
Thank you for your feedback.
